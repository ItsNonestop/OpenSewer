# OpenSewer

OpenSewer is a BepInEx 5 mod for the game **Obenseuer** that adds an in-game menu allowing different features such as:
- Item Spawning
- Furniture Spawning
- Player Stats Viewing/Editing
- Time Control

While all these features can be done in game without any mods, the menu provided a all in one centralised place for these features, as well as making it easier to find/visualise which items/furnitures/stats you will be adding.
