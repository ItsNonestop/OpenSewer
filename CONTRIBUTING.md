# Contributing to OpenSewer

## Setup

1. Fork the repo.
2. Copy required managed DLLs into `GameLibs/` (see `GameLibs/README.md`).
3. Build with `./build.ps1`.

## Guidelines

- Keep gameplay behavior stable unless explicitly discussing gameplay changes.
- Prefer small, focused pull requests.
- Include clear reproduction steps for bug fixes.
- Update docs if install/build behavior changes.

## Pull Requests

- Use descriptive titles.
- Summarize what changed and why.
- Mention any manual test coverage (in-game checks).
